# ASTEROIDS PROJECT
### Machine Learning project prepared by DataBusters
Data for the project come from the dataset published on kaggle.com and shared by NASA.

Project structure:
1. EDA - Explanatory Data Analysis of the data set
2. Flask
   * asteroids_main.py - main application file
   * /templates - webpages used in flask application
   * /model - machine learning models in pkl format
   * /static - static files like images used in the web app
3. Models
   * <_machine learning model_> - jupyter notebooks with differnt ML models
   * Model.ipynb - data preprocessing file
    * data import
    * standardization
    * onehotencoding
    * dropping columns
    * list of model
    * list of hyperparameters
    * dataset splitting
    * hyperparameters optimization
    * model training and fitting
    * results predicting
    * dataset balancing (undersampling, oversampling)
